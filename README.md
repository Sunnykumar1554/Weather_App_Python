Weather App (Python)
Developed a desktop-based weather application using Python that fetches real-time weather data from API (OpenWeatherMap). The app allows users to input a city name and displays current weather condition including temperatures, humidity, wind speed, and weather description. Utilized requests for API integration and tkinter for a user-friendly GUI.
